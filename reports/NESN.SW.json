  "technical_view": "Nestl\u00e9 S.A. (NESN.SW) is currently trading at 74.53 CHF, which is very close to its 52-week low of 69.9 CHF and significantly below its 52-week high of 91.72 CHF. The stock has been in a general downtrend since May 2025, characterized by lower highs and lower lows, indicating bearish momentum. The current price action suggests the stock is testing critical support levels around the 70-75 CHF range. A sustained break below the 52-week low of 69.9 CHF could signal further declines, while a rebound from current levels could indicate a potential reversal or consolidation phase.",
