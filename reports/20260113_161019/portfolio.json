      "ticker": "NESN.SW",
      "weight": 0.45,
      "reasoning": "Defensive positioning with strong 4.07% dividend yield provides steady income in uncertain markets. Despite recent 18.3% decline from 52-week high, the elevated PE of 18.74 suggests some valuation compression opportunity. Neutral recommendation with 0.72 score indicates stability. Larger allocation captures defensive characteristics and dividend income while the recent pullback presents value."

    {
      "ticker": "ROG.SW",
      "weight": 0.55,
      "reasoning": "BUY recommendation with strong uptrend momentum from November 2025 onwards supports growth potential. While PE of 28.85 reflects premium valuation, the positive momentum and 2.83% dividend yield justify the higher weighting. Larger allocation captures the growth trajectory and positive technical momentum, balancing the portfolio's growth component against NESN.SW's defensive characteristics."
