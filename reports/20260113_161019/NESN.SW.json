  "technical_view": "NESN.SW exhibits a bearish technical pattern with a clear downtrend established since March 2025 peak of CHF 88.50. The stock has formed lower highs and lower lows, breaking below key support levels. Current price of CHF 74.97 is near the 52-week low of CHF 69.90, indicating sustained selling pressure. The recent bounce from August lows (CHF 71.10) has failed to sustain above CHF 80, suggesting weak momentum. Volume and trend analysis indicate continued downside risk unless the stock stabilizes above CHF 76-77 support level. A break below the 52-week low would signal further deterioration.",
