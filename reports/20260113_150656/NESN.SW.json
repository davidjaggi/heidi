  "technical_view": "NESN.SW is currently trading at 74.71 CHF, significantly below its 52-week high of 91.72 CHF and close to its 52-week low of 69.9 CHF. The stock has experienced a notable downtrend since its peak in Q2 2025, with recent price action showing a decline from October 2025 highs. The current price level is testing the lower bound of its annual trading range, suggesting potential support around the 69.9 CHF mark. While short-term momentum is bearish, the proximity to the 52-week low could indicate an oversold condition and a potential reversal point for long-term investors seeking value.",
