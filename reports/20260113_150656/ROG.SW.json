  "technical_view": "Roche Holding AG (ROG.SW) has demonstrated a robust bullish trend since October 2025, recovering significantly from its 52-week low of 231.9 CHF. The stock is currently trading at 339.6 CHF, just shy of its 52-week high of 342.9 CHF. This indicates strong buying pressure and positive market sentiment. A decisive break above the 52-week high would signal further upside potential and a continuation of the uptrend. Immediate support levels can be identified around the 325-330 CHF range, which served as a recent consolidation area. The overall technical picture is bullish, suggesting continued upward momentum, though investors should be mindful of potential short-term consolidation or minor pullbacks given its proximity to the all-time high.",
