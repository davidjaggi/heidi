  "technical_view": "NESN.SW exhibits a bearish technical pattern over the past 12 months. The stock peaked at CHF 88.50 in late March 2025 and has since declined approximately 15.3% to the current price of CHF 74.96. The price action shows a series of lower highs and lower lows, particularly evident from June through September 2025. Recent consolidation in the CHF 74-80 range suggests potential support, but the overall trend remains downward. The stock is trading near the lower end of its 52-week range (CHF 69.90-91.72), indicating weakness. A break below CHF 74 would signal further downside risk, while recovery above CHF 82 would be needed to confirm a reversal.",
